# Where the fuck is board game night?

This is the source code for the [r/Denver](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/)
Wednesday board game group website that tells you, simply, where board game night
is located.

I was inspired by [is there a fucking rockies game](https://github.com/baer/isThereAFuckingGame)
and thought that we needed something similar for the Wednesday board game night crew.
